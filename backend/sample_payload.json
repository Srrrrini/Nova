  "transcript": "Alice: Let's align on sprint focus: shipping the 3.1 authentication fixes and tightening docs. Bob: Login failures were traced to the blueprint auth middleware; we need to refactor session refresh logic in flask/sessions.py and add regression tests. Priya: Deployment playbooks still reference the legacy WSGI config—I'll update the container recipe and CI workflow. Jonas: Docs need a migration note for the new session cookie flags, plus guidance for extensions. Alice: Great. Target mid-sprint for code complete, end of sprint for release candidate. Call out risks as we go.",
